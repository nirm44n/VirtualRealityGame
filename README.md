HoboLoco is a patent-pending computer input device that is operated like a “hoverboard”. To guide an avatar or vehicle in Virtual Reality, the user stands on two foot pads and slightly flexes one or both feet. Sensitive sensors communicate the user’s movements to a game or other, enabling the user to maneuver naturallythrough a virtual building, over virtual streets, or through other cyber environments without being hindered. HoboLoco is a “game changer” for Virtual Reality game developers and users.

HoboLoco provides natural movements of forward, backward & spin for users in any 2D or 3D computer environment. There is no need to modify the game to support teleporting or keep the user from running into walls. A demo VR environment was created using Unity and features urban and rural scenes and extends the virtual world without walls. The prototype uses sensors to transfer user input into an Arduino that is then output to the Unity environment. Haptic vibrations can be generated to simulate traveling over rough surfaces and abrupt stops. 

The end result is the user experiences the natural sensations of gliding over concrete, ground, and grass while being enveloped by city buildings and through the trees of a forest.
